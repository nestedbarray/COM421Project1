  The Toolbox project was my first html/css project. I am pretty happy with how the web pages look and how they act. However they are pretty barebones when it comes to styling. Maybe adding images (like stock images or ai created images) could've added more personalization, same with icons. I saw the icons in the linked google drive but I was unsure how to make use of them. I could make some custom icons in photoshop or through another software for each of the buttons leading to the webpages instead of it just being text. I chose the color choice of a near white background, blue title card, grey button bar, and yellow accents as that is something I liked. Instead, I could look into more popular color styles for websites to attract more attention. Coding wise, the html documents could probably use better spacing and categories to make it easier for another reader to understand there exploration. The same goes for the CSS styling file, I kinda just threw it up together so it's a complete mess and organizing that would be a must if any future additions would be made. Otherwise I am quite happy with the result of this project.
